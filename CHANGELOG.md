# Changelog

## v0.5.0 — 2026-09-23

### Added

- Optional, read-only PrusaLink observation source: polls only `GET /api/v1/status`, appends normalized `source_observation` records to the existing timeline, and reports source health, printer state, bed actual/target, freshness, and last error. Disabled by default and paused during SSE Churn.
- A bounded one-hour rolling retention reserve for PrusaLink observations on top of the existing 2,000-record live baseline, shared by memory-only and persistent observers.
- A single `workflow_dispatch` release workflow for stable and RC releases: exact package-version match, full test gates, wheel build and clean install, immutable-SHA container smoke test, annotated tag, version promotion, GitHub Release with wheel, and `latest` promotion for stable releases only.
- RC tag support in the container promotion workflow.
- A documented, validated trusted-LAN HTTPS topology for evidence downloads (`docs/lan-https-validation.md`): a locally trusted certificate terminated in front of the loopback listener, forwarding `Host` and `Origin` unchanged.
- MIT license file.

### Fixed

- Device-originated JSON containing lone surrogates no longer reaches local structured surfaces. Raw response text is kept unchanged as evidence; parsed data is `null` with a deterministic `parse_error`. Applies to `/api/v2/info`, `/api/v2/state`, `/api/v2/health`, HTTP/SSE rejection bodies, and SSE event data. Closes the v0.4.0 known limitation tracked in #33.
- GHCR promotion `curl` calls use HTTP/1.1 with bounded retries, fixing a repeatable token-fetch transfer failure that blocked version promotion.

### Validation

- Brave HTTP-vs-HTTPS A/B test across localhost, LAN HTTP, and LAN HTTPS with Shields on and off: the insecure-download warning appears only for plain HTTP on a LAN address and is independent of Shields and response headers (#26).
- Hardware use: two 8-hour Long Haul Thermal captures against a DragonBreath device completed with correct run identity, lease-expiry fail-safe handling, and zero HTTP/JSON failures.

### Known limitations

- DragonSniff itself still serves plain HTTP only. HTTPS requires the documented reverse-proxy topology.
- Authentication and public or untrusted-network deployment remain unsupported.
- `v0.5.0-rc.1` was tagged but never completed promotion or publication; `v0.5.0` supersedes it.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-09-08

### Added

- Durable, idempotent operator annotations for active Thermal captures, including quick-pick markers, exact freeform notes, capture-relative and UTC timing, and optional external-instrument correlation metadata.
- Local retry resolution for interrupted annotation submissions without duplicate evidence or DUT-facing mutation traffic.

### Validation

- Exercise a genuine lost client response on the NAS after the annotation was durably stored, restart DragonSniff, and confirm that retrying the same UUID and logical content returns the original record with `created: false` and no duplicate.
- Confirm annotations remain ordered with telemetry, survive reload, reconnect, graceful restart, and interrupted-capture recovery, and export without content or identity loss.
- Confirm the observed-device request audit remains GET-only and annotation capacity neither evicts nor corrupts telemetry evidence.

### Known limitations

- Issue #33 remains open for device-originated lone-surrogate serialization hardening. Operator-input Unicode validation is implemented; malformed Unicode originating from a device is separate and is not claimed fixed here.
- Authentication, HTTPS, and public or untrusted-network deployment remain unsupported.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-09-08

### Added

- Explicit bind, port, and log-level configuration for headless/container use.
- A hardware-independent `/healthz` service-liveness endpoint.
- A versioned server/container status and remaining-work reference.
- Distinct filenames for active-session, Thermal-capture, and SSE-churn exports.
- Dragon-family navigation with separate Dashboard, Thermal, Churn, and Evidence surfaces plus the unlinked `/lab` display controls.
- Automatic pause and restoration of live observation around completed, cancelled, or failed automated runs.
- Dedicated Thermal and Churn JSONL downloads that remain available after observation resumes.
- Live retained-record budget feedback for passive-capture schedules.
- Bounded eight-worker local request handling so a slow automation transition does not freeze status polling.
- Incremental append-only evidence persistence with interrupted-run recovery and bounded retention.
- Read-only session history API, UI, and purpose-specific historical JSONL downloads.
- Exact normalized target allowlisting for unattended service operation.
- A non-root Docker image and host-loopback Compose deployment with persistent storage and health checks.
- Exact trusted browser authorities for direct trusted-LAN deployment without rewriting `Host` or `Origin` headers.
- Public GHCR images tagged as `latest` and immutable full commit SHAs.
- A direct, hardened Portainer deployment guide using the published image.
- GitHub funding metadata for the project's Ko-fi page.

### Fixed

- Clarify active mode and consequential stop actions across desktop and compact layouts.
- Handle SIGTERM with the same bounded session cleanup used by local shutdown.
- Keep the active timeline and global JSONL export on the same authoritative recorder after an automated run.
- Preserve a pending observation return across chained automated runs and prevent observer workers from starting after server shutdown.
- Retain the latest capture and churn evidence independently across later observation sessions and automated runs; unavailable run exports now return 404 instead of a zero-byte evidence file.
- Validate hash routes against owned page names, scope expert polling preferences to `/lab`, and use valid current-page navigation semantics.
- Stream historical downloads from a fixed initial file length instead of allocating the complete evidence file in memory.
- Return `404 session_evidence_not_available` instead of a zero-byte current-session download when no current evidence exists.
- Preserve every complete record, including a final unmatched request, when startup classifies an unfinished run as `interrupted`.
- Record malformed HTTP status lines and other HTTP protocol failures as truthful failed samples without aborting a bounded capture or inventing a response.

### Validation

- Cover resumed exports, cancelled-run restoration, chained automation, shutdown races, route rejection, and capture-budget gating behavior.
- Cover durable write ordering, crash-window metadata reconciliation, partial-record quarantine, retention, allowlisting, history downloads, and container security defaults.
- Keep package metadata, the exported module version, and HTTP client/server identifiers on one authoritative version source.

### Known limitations

- HTTPS deployment is not yet supported, and Brave may warn about JSONL downloads over plain LAN HTTP; this remains tracked in Issue #26.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-09-05

### Added

- Bounded passive thermal capture with Smoke, Soak, Extended, and Long Haul profiles.
- Independent state and health sampling schedules with raw JSONL evidence retention.
- Per-run recorder sizing so validated long-haul captures retain their opening records.
- Live chamber, PTC, target, PID demand, commanded duty, approach limit, and constraint telemetry.
- A compact real-time PID output gauge that degrades cleanly when optional fields are absent.
- Repeatable Baseline, Extended, and Stress profiles for bounded sequential SSE churn testing.

### Improved

- Monotonic per-fetch sequencing and consistent terminal capture counters.
- Post-churn settlement evidence and cleanup reporting without inventing crash or recovery causes.
- Validation coverage for capture scheduling, record budgets, telemetry extraction, and gauge rendering.

### Safety and scope

DragonSniff remains passive and loopback-only. This release adds no device mutations, actuator controls, generic proxying, OTA behavior, or unbounded capture mode.
