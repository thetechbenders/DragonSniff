# Passive thermal telemetry capture

DragonSniff can collect a bounded, deterministic series of raw Dragon API observations while a controller is exercised elsewhere. The capture runner is deliberately passive: it issues only fixed `GET` requests to `/api/v2/info`, `/api/v2/state`, and `/api/v2/health`. It does not open SSE, set a target, select a mode, acknowledge a fault, or become part of the control loop.

## Profiles

| Profile | Duration | State cadence | Health cadence | Intended use |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Smoke | 2 minutes | 1 second | 10 seconds | Confirm fields, identity, and short-run stability. |
| Soak | 15 minutes | 2 seconds | 30 seconds | Capture a normal warm-up or target-hold interval. |
| Extended | 30 minutes | 5 seconds | 60 seconds | Observe longer resource and steady-state behavior. |
| Long Haul | 8 hours | 5 seconds | 60 seconds | Observe full thermal soak, equilibrium drift, and long-run resource behavior. |

Every value remains visible and editable. An edited profile becomes **Custom** and is still checked against hard bounds. A schedule is rejected when its estimated request/response records could exceed the retained-session budget. This preserves the project's rule that a completed nominal run must not silently discard its own evidence.
The Thermal tab previews that estimate while the schedule is edited and disables Start when the configured run would exceed the budget; the server repeats the same validation authoritatively.

## Evidence model

At the beginning of a run, DragonSniff captures device information. It then polls state and health independently on monotonic schedules. At the duration boundary it captures final state, health, and device information before completing.

If an endpoint responds too slowly to maintain the requested cadence, DragonSniff advances the schedule instead of issuing a burst of catch-up requests. The timestamps and elapsed request times preserve that timing evidence.

Each request and response retains:

- UTC and monotonic timestamps
- run ID, monotonic per-fetch sequence, owner, and sample point
- endpoint, status, headers, and elapsed time
- exact response text when transport bytes decode as strict UTF-8; otherwise a
  marked replacement-decoded view plus `decode_error`
- parsed JSON when every decoded string is UTF-8 encodable and the structure is
  within the local admission depth, or a deterministic parsing/validation error
  and machine-readable `parse_error_kind` when structured data is unavailable

Unknown and product-specific fields remain untouched. Missing optional fields do not fail a capture. State or health request failures increment visible counters and remain evidence rather than being converted into invented controller conclusions.

When the optional PrusaLink source is configured, its read-only status attempts append `source_observation` records to this same recorder. Recorder `sequence` remains the authoritative cross-source arrival order. The source carries its own provenance, normalized printer fields, request timing, freshness, and failure state; it never adds printer fields to Dragon response records or reconstructs Jump Jet policy. See [Optional PrusaLink observations](prusalink-observation.md).

Successfully decoded DUT text remains evidence even when syntactically valid JSON
contains an unpaired surrogate escape. In that case the response text is retained
exactly, while the parsed object is withheld from structured capture and local API
surfaces. The malformed parsed text is not repaired or replaced. Invalid transport
UTF-8 is different: the safe textual field contains replacement characters and is
explicitly marked by `decode_error`, so it is not claimed as byte-exact evidence.

While a capture is running, the Thermal tab can append local operator annotations to the same ordered evidence timeline. Quick-pick markers and exact freeform notes never contact the observed device. Their UTC and capture-relative timestamps represent when DragonSniff received the operator action, not an inferred physical-event time. See [Operator annotations](operator-annotations.md) for the record and retry contract.

`samples_completed` counts state snapshots specifically. Every completed info, state,
or health fetch also advances `fetches_completed`, and its request/response evidence
carries that run-local value as `fetch_sequence`.

Health observations track a present `boot_id`. A change is reported with the two observed values and fetch location, but DragonSniff does not label it a crash or infer a cause.

## PID release-candidate workflow

1. Start the Dragon firmware build being tested and control its heater through its normal supported interface.
2. Run the Smoke profile to confirm that the expected identity and telemetry fields are present.
3. Run Soak during a representative warm-up and hold.
4. Run Extended when longer steady-state or resource evidence is useful.
5. Run Long Haul for a supervised full-system thermal soak when slow enclosure,
   controller, or resource drift is the question.
6. Use **Download thermal capture JSONL** after each run. The stable download name is `dragonsniff-thermal-capture.jsonl`; add the firmware build and test condition when archiving it. This run-specific export remains available after live observation resumes.
7. Repeat the same profile and physical test condition against the comparison build.

The resulting JSONL supports later analysis of temperatures, targets, requested and delivered output, constraint reasons, heap, uptime, and boot identity when those fields are exposed by the product. DragonSniff preserves those values and never defines what they should be. Acceptance criteria remain part of the product's validation plan; [Assess](assess.md) can evaluate a completed capture against criteria the product supplies, and its findings are derived output, not a safety certification.

## Traffic and lifecycle bounds

- One capture-owned device connection at a time
- Serialized endpoint polling
- No SSE connection during capture
- No overlap with ordinary observation or churn
- 1–43,200 second duration bounds
- 0.5–60 second state interval bounds
- 5–300 second health interval bounds
- Maximum 25,000 estimated Dragon scheduled records; each normal capture recorder also
  reserves space for up to 1,000 operator annotations so markers do not displace
  nominal telemetry evidence. An enabled PrusaLink source receives a separate
  bounded polling allowance of at most 3,602 records. Memory-only and persistent
  paths calculate the same combined capacity. The Dragon schedule and annotation
  headroom are included in that capacity, but all kinds still share normal FIFO
  eviction if actual source attempts exceed the capped estimate during a dense,
  long capture. Persistent JSONL remains append-only.
- Stop prevents future samples and retains everything already observed

An in-flight read remains bounded by the existing client request timeout. While it finishes, the run truthfully remains `stopping`; a replacement observation, churn run, or capture cannot start.
