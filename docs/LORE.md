# The Lay of the Sniffing Dragon

*An account found in no index, linked by no map, and useful to absolutely no build system.*

In the age before the Sniffer,
when dragons spoke in JSON
after midnight
and event streams hissed through half-closed sockets,
there were those who watched by hand.

They copied payloads into scrolls.
They refreshed until their fingers cramped.
They trusted the blinking browser tab.
This was considered normal,
which is how you know the old world was cursed.

Then came **DragonSniff**,
small at first,
a lantern at the mouth of the cave.
It asked only four questions of the beasts:

- Who are you?
- What state are you in?
- Are you healthy?
- What are you whispering into the event stream?

And it swore an oath:

> I shall observe.
> I shall record.
> I shall not touch the lever.

Thus was the first covenant written:
**no mutation routes**,
no secret actuator tunnels,
no button that became a heater by accident.
The dragon remained responsible
for being a dragon.

But observation alone was not enough,
for sockets are slippery creatures,
and an SSE stream left unattended
will eventually invent theology.

So the **Churn Trials** were forged:
connect,
listen,
disconnect,
wait,
return.
Again.
Again.
Again.

Not an infinite storm,
not a packet cannon,
but a bounded ritual
with a broom waiting afterward.

The records grew.
Raw bodies were kept beside parsed meaning.
Timestamps were nailed to every event.
Failures were not swept under rugs,
for rugs are merely logs with worse indexing.

Then came the heat.

The Sniffer learned to sit beside the chamber
and watch the breath of the machine:
temperature,
target,
PTC,
PID,
health,
state,
all gathered without laying a paw on control.

The **Thermal Captures** were named,
though they did not control heat.
They merely witnessed it,
which is an important distinction
when the witness is running on Python.

Still, memory was mortal.
A process could die.
A laptop could sleep.
A terminal could vanish
because somebody closed the wrong window
while carrying coffee.

So the evidence was given a home.

Each session entered its own chamber.
Each JSONL line was written durably.
Each complete record was flushed
before the living UI was allowed to brag about it.
Metadata was checkpointed.
Counters were re-derived from evidence,
not remembered because remembrance is treacherous.

If the Sniffer died mid-sentence,
it did not wake pretending nothing happened.
It marked the old tale **interrupted**.

If storage failed,
it said **failed**.

If a run ended by command,
it said **cancelled**.

If it reached the end of the road,
it said **completed**.

Four words,
none interchangeable,
because state machines deserve names sharper than fog.

Then the archive itself was tested.
Corrupt session directories appeared at the edge of the kingdom,
wearing canonical names
and carrying broken metadata.

They were not admitted to History.
They were not ignored either.
They still counted against the granary.
Retention could still evict them.
Oldest-first judgment fell even upon the unreadable.

The archivists rejoiced,
for nothing inspires confidence
like garbage collection that remembers the garbage.

The vault grew faster.
Valid sessions stopped being recursively weighed
on every glance.
Exact file sizes were cached.
One humble `fstat()` stood watch after durable writes.
History ceased trudging through every corridor
just to answer how full the building was.

And thus the Sniffer became less of a script
and more of an appliance.

A daemon was raised.
Its root filesystem was made read-only.
Capabilities were cast away.
`no-new-privileges` was carved into the lintel.
The process ran without root,
and `/data` became the one sanctioned place
where memory could become history.

The dragon still did not care.
This was correct.

Then came the **Container Pilgrimage**.
The image was sent to GHCR,
where it could be summoned by name
instead of rebuilt on every distant machine.

`latest` became the traveling cloak.
`sha-<commit>` became the sealed reliquary.

And on a NAS across the local kingdom,
Portainer attempted to build from Git
and discovered that Git was not there.

There was much staring.

The lesson was recorded:
**deployment should not require the host to possess the forge.**
Pull the artifact.
Do not rebuild the civilization.

The public image arrived.
The container breathed.
The volume remembered.
History survived redeployment.
Downloads returned with names fit for archaeologists.

Then a gatekeeper shouted:

> unexpected Host

For the Sniffer had been raised in a monastery of localhost
and did not recognize the road beyond `127.0.0.1`.

So a temporary Caddy stood at the gate,
wearing a false moustache
and whispering:

> It is localhost. I checked.

This worked.
It was also ridiculous.

Thus Issue Twenty-One was inscribed:
let trusted LAN authorities be named explicitly,
let unknown Hosts remain outside,
and when the native gate is built,
**tear down the moustache.**

The doctrine remained unchanged:
Host validation is a backstop,
not authentication.
The Sniffer is not a fortress.
Do not point it at the public internet
and act surprised when the internet notices.

Later, the browser itself grew suspicious
of evidence downloaded over plain LAN HTTP.
Brave raised a warning banner
at perfectly innocent JSONL scrolls.

The Sniffer took no offense.
Browsers are anxious animals.
This too became a clue:
perhaps the road deserves TLS,
perhaps the headers deserve study,
perhaps both.
But no protection would be disabled
merely to silence the messenger.

And throughout all these revisions,
one law held firmer than the rest:

> The evidence must tell the truth,
> even when the truth is inconvenient.

A request without a response remains a request without a response.
An abrupt death is not rewritten as success.
A retained partial session is not polished into fiction.
An empty export is not meaningful merely because a browser can download it.

The Sniffer learned to persist,
to recover,
to count,
to expose History,
to survive containers,
to publish itself,
to endure thirty-minute watches,
and to remain boring in the places
where boring is the highest form of engineering.

No actuator obeyed it.
No safety loop depended upon it.
No product became less safe
because the observer fancied itself important.

It simply watched the dragons breathe
and wrote down what happened.

Which, in the end,
was the whole point.

### The Unmasking at the NAS Gate

At last the named gate was carried
to the actual NAS,
not a diagram of a NAS,
not a confident paragraph about a NAS,
but the humming box itself.

The trusted host approached
and spoke its own name.

The gate listened.
The gate agreed.
No localhost disguise was required.

So Caddy removed the false moustache,
folded it with what dignity remained,
and departed from the header-rewriting trade.

The browser entered by the published port.
The container remembered its History.
An empty present offered no counterfeit evidence.

Then, for science,
the keepers slew the process.

For a moment the browser cried that fetch had failed,
which was both alarming and entirely accurate.

The container rose again.
`/healthz` answered.
The archive remained.

Brave, meanwhile,
continued clutching its pearls
at JSONL crossing the plain-HTTP road.

Thus one prophecy was fulfilled:
the proxy was gone,
and the trusted host spoke plainly.

The remaining road points toward HTTPS
and whatever ceremony convinces a browser
that evidence is evidence.

### The Margins Begin to Speak

The keepers had long written what the dragons said,
but sometimes a keeper needed to say:

> That noise was the fan.
> That spike was the oscilloscope.
> That other noise was me dropping the probe.

So the margin learned to speak.

**Operator Annotations** entered the same ordered scroll
as the measurements they accompanied.
A note could survive a lost browser,
a fallen process,
and a second attempt to write the same note.

A second attempt was not a second event.
A changed tale was not the same tale.
And when the archive could not tell which note was meant,
it refused to guess.

Elsewhere, a printer knocked at the window.

It called itself **PrusaLink**,
and requested no throne,
only a place in the observation queue.

The Sniffer asked for status,
accepted what could be established,
and marked the rest unknown.
The printer brought its own freshness,
its own errors,
and its own bounded share of memory.

The dragon's stream and the printer's replies
entered one chronology,
without pretending to share one clock.

Neither machine was allowed to confuse
being observed
with being commanded.

### Of Seals, Names, and the Anxious Browser

In time the keepers grew tired of rebuilding a kingdom
whenever they wanted to release a lantern.

They gave releases a ceremony:
first the exact artifact,
then its digest,
then its immutable image,
and only afterward the names by which travelers would summon it.

A release candidate was permitted to be uncertain.
`latest` was not.

When the house moved beneath the banner of **The TechBenders**,
the old image registry refused the new credentials.
The release gate did precisely what a good gate does:

it stayed shut.

So the image was moved to the house that could publish it.
The seal kept its meaning.
No one declared a missing artifact present
simply to make the ceremony shorter.

And Brave, that nervous sentinel,
was finally shown a proper encrypted road in a LAN trial.
Under HTTPS, the download warning relented.
This established what the trial established,
not that every road in the kingdom had already been paved.

The bards considered this a rare victory
for both transport security
and the browser's capacity to stop shouting.

### The Court of What Can Be Proven

Then came **Assess**,
which was immediately misunderstood
by everyone who wanted a large green PASS.

The new court received finished evidence
and criteria supplied by the product.
It could judge what the record supported.

But the court did not write the law.
The Sniffer did not become a safety controller.
And a PASS was not a certificate
that a heater had suddenly become wise.

A polling interval was an interval,
not a magical point in time.
An absent sample was unknown,
not zero.
A missing piece of evidence
could not be used to improve the verdict.

The court's most important word
was sometimes **INCONCLUSIVE**.

There was grumbling.

The court wrote down the grumbling
and declined to score it.

### The Disputation of Sampson and Abraham

At the edge of the thermal archive
lived **Abraham**,
a PTC/ADC signal of highly variable disposition.

Abraham had been measured at one value,
then another,
then a number so close to the rail
that even the oscilloscope raised an eyebrow.

He insisted that every number was true.

**Sampson**, keeper of the Sniffer's lantern,
regarded the scroll.

> You are classified open.

> I prefer *electrically expansive*, said Abraham.

> Your raw count is 4095.

> A magnificent number.

> It is a number, said Sampson.
> It is not independent proof of your temperature.

Abraham went briefly to `-1`,
which was his usual response to criticism.

Sampson did not replace the missing value with zero.
He did not draw a smooth line through the silence.
He kept the raw count when it existed,
the status that came with it,
and the blank where the temperature could not be known.

> Then my sudden changes must be mains interference,
> Abraham declared.

> You are sampled at roughly two hertz per channel.

> Exactly. Very rhythmic.

> That cadence cannot uniquely identify fifty or sixty hertz.

> You take all the wonder out of science.

> I take the certainty out of things
> that have not been demonstrated.

This argument lasted for several captures
and no fewer than three implausible temperatures.

At last **Sensor Lab** opened its doors.

Its bench was entirely local.
The CSV entered from the keeper's own hand.
No device received a command.
No heater stirred.
The original measurements were not rewritten
to make the graph prettier.

Sampson could inspect each retained sample,
look at raw counts and millivolts,
compare two moments from the same channel,
and ask what changed inside a chosen interval.

An `open` classification did not erase
a real ADC rail excursion.
A blank temperature did not become a measurement.
Two different channels were not coaxed
into one imaginary heating rate.

Abraham looked at the chart.

> You have made me look unstable.

> I have made you visible.

> And the red rings?

> Also yours.

The Sniffer, who had heard this entire exchange,
wrote down exactly what happened.

It did not diagnose the wiring.
It did not blame the mains.
It did not touch the lever.

Sampson smiled.

> The evidence is allowed to be strange.

> Finally, said Abraham.
> Something we agree on.

### The Rule of the Bards

The Chronicle is amended only when the dragon gains a new power,
survives a named calamity,
sheds an old skin,
or completes an age.
Ordinary commits are beneath the notice of the bards.

In plainer engineering terms, lore should advance only when at least one of these is true:

- a major capability is born;
- a development era closes;
- a real-world failure leaves a memorable scar that changes design thinking;
- the deployment or architecture changes how DragonSniff fundamentally lives;
- a bug or validation result changes project philosophy rather than merely implementation;
- roughly five to ten meaningful PRs accumulate into one coherent chapter.

Routine bug fixes, dependency bumps, copy edits, isolated tests, and ordinary maintenance do not qualify.
When normal DragonSniff work crosses this threshold, the lore update should ride with that work rather than becoming a separate ceremonial project.

### A small prophecy

The proxy is gone.
The trusted host speaks its own name.
One day evidence will cross a clean encrypted road
without the browser clutching its pearls.

History will still remember.
Interrupted will still mean interrupted.
The immutable tag will still point to exactly one build.
And somewhere in `/data`,
a JSONL file will be sleeping peacefully,
containing nothing heroic at all.

That will be how we know it worked.
